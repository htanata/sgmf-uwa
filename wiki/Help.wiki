  * How to fill the Fund ID?
    Go to FundIdReference and find the fund name and the associated fund ID.

  * What is the number after the fund's name?
   It's the date (day) of the price. This is added because the price update is not always at the same time.

  * Why don't you put the fund name as a drop down list so I don't have to see the fund ID reference?
   I wish I could but the list is quite large and the widget would not load when I tried it. Besides, it will make the widget size quite big. And since you don't select the fund name everyday, I guess this is the best way.

  * How about more than 5 funds?
   The short answer is: "Just add more of the widgets!" Yes, that's what I do. If more people ask, I'll probably give 10 funds. The thing is, the number of funds can't be chosen dynamically, as fas as the way I code it anyway.
